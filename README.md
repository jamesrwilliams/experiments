# ðŸ§ª Experiments

A collection of my strange scripts, side projects, snippets, and sandboxes. Anything I've started and not finished, or any experiments I did not get off the ground can be found here.

The idea behind this repo was shamelessly stolen from [adriancarriger/experiments](https://github.com/adriancarriger/experiments). And it's social image is 

## Contents

- [random](./random) - A collection of random stuff.
- [javascript](./javascript) - Anything Javascript related.
- [chrome-extension](./chrome-extension) - An attempt at a Chrome browser extension.

These sections are the ones with a README so they can be found via the GitHub pages build. Otherwise you'll just be looking at source :(.
