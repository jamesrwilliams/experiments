# stdlib Workspace

This is a sub-collection of things that will be part of the [Standard Library](https://stdlib.com/). The Standard Library is an all-in-one API development, management and hosting solution that lets you build integrations.

These are then globally namespaced to the user. E.g my countdown would be accessible via `jamesrwilliams.countdown` and with an endpoint of: http://jamesrwilliams.api.stdlib.com/countdown/.
 
See the getting started guide on the repo [stdlib/lib](https://github.com/stdlib/lib).
